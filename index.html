          <p style="text-align: left;">
            <span style="line-height: 2; font-size: 1.25rem;">Ever since the invention of plastics we have progressively began to use this convenient material more and more. From packaging our food, to sealing and protecting birthday gifts, however once we open the packaging or empty our plastics bags their usefulness drops to zero. Recycling efforts are increasing every year, but even recycling will not solve our problem of dependency that we have nor remove the environmental damage and energyloss that comes with it.&nbsp;</span>
          </p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>The world now produces more than 380 million tonnes of plastic every year, which could end up as pollutants, entering our natural environment and oceans.</p>
            <p>Of course, not all of our plastic waste ends up in the ocean, most ends up in landfills: it’s estimated that the share of global plastic waste that enters the ocean is around 3%. In 2010 – the year for which we have the latest estimates – that was around 8 million tonnes.</p>
            <p>Most of the plastic materials we produce are less dense than water and should therefore float at the ocean surface. But our best estimates of the amount of plastic afloat at sea are orders of magnitude lower than the amount of plastic that enters our oceans in a single year: as we show in the visualization, it’s far lower than 8 million tonnes and instead in the order of 10s to 100s of thousands of tonnes. One of the most widely-quoted estimates is 250,000 tonnes.</p>

          <h1 style="text-align: left;">Textiles</h1>
          <p style="text-align: left;">Getting the latest in fashion trends has never been easier, there are countless websites and shops who will sell you both luxurious expensive brands to show off to friend and colleague alike or will offer you pretty much the exact same clothing for a much more affordable price, albeit with less alure.<br>
            <br>This trend of fast fashion, gone are the days of multi year trends, also leads to a exponential growth of pollution. Not only are we buying more clothing, we simultaneously throw away more than ever before. Stores even prefer to cut and discard their old clothing rather than to give it away, which still wouldnt solve the problem, because they have to protect the value and status of their respected brands.&nbsp;
          </p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>It takes a lot of water to produce textile, plus land to grow cotton and other fibres. It is estimated that the global textile and clothing industry used 79 billion cubic metres of water in 2015, while the needs of the EU's whole economy amounted to 266 billion cubic metres in 2017. To make a single cotton t-shirt, 2,700 litres of fresh water are required according to estimates, enough to meet one person’s drinking needs for 2.5 years.</p>
            <p>Textile production is estimated to be responsible for about 20% of global clean water pollution from dyeing and finishing products.</p>
            <p>Washing synthetics releases an estimated 0.5 million tonnes of microfibres into the ocean a year.laundering synthetic clothes accounts for 35% of primary microplastics released into the environment.A single laundry load of polyester clothes can discharge 700,000 microplastic fibres that can end up in the food chain.</p>

          <h1 style="text-align: left;">Fossil fuels</h1>
          <p style="text-align: left;">Twenty companies are responsible for roughly one third of all carbon emissions, companies like Saudi Aramco, Gazprom, BP, Royal Shell and PetroChina, the continued use and promotion of oil and fossil fuels in general is reminiscent of the arguments held by Big Tobacco during the decades long media war and litigation. All of this in the name of profit and their own interest, the other 7.6 billion people on earth can all go to hell. <br>It is our duty and in our common interest to get rid of this 'black gold' as soon as humanly possible, yesterday rather than tomorrow.&nbsp;
          </p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>We’ve all paid a utility bill or purchased gasoline. Those represent the direct costs of fossil fuels; money paid out of pocket for energy from coal, natural gas, and oil.</p>
            <p>But those expenses don’t reflect the total cost of fossil fuels to each of us individually or to society as a whole. Known as externalities, the hidden costs of fossil fuels aren’t represented in their market price, despite serious impacts to our health and environment.</p>
            <p>Externalities are sometimes easy to see, such as pollution and land degradation, and sometimes less obvious, such as the costs of asthma and cancer, or the impacts of sea level rise. Many consequences are far removed from our daily lives and may only affect a minority or marginalized subset of the population.</p>
            <p>Costs accrue at every point of the fossil fuel supply chain. Extraction processes can generate air and water pollution, and harm local communities. Transporting fuels from the mine or well can cause air pollution and lead to serious accidents and spills. When the fuels are burned, they emit toxins and global warming emissions. Even the waste products are hazardous to public health and the environment.</p>
